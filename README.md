# ComplexRNN
Complex-valued neural networks are applied to a variety of disciplines, including array signal processing, radar and magnetic resonance data imaging, communication systems, and interval data processing. Complex representations in recurrent neural networks could gain more acceptance if they were shown to be compatible with both real-valued and complex-valued datasets competitive for real-world data. This work suggests a variation of RNN model, with complex valued weights and activations and displays its simple implementation with a standard deep learning library, TensorFlow, that offers limited support for complex calculus. The contributions of this thesis are summarised as follows.
* The work implements several complex-weighted recurrent neural network architectures with a standard deep learning library (TensorFlow).
* The thesis compares the performance of both real-valued and complex-weighted RNN for the synthetic task of modelling chaotic systems and real-world application of human motion modelling experimentally; this is one of the first works to explore human motion modelling using Unitary RNN.
* The complex-weighted networks presented in this thesis are stable and fast to train; it surpasses the performance of real- valued counterparts with equal parameters on both synthetic tasks and the real-world application of predicting next sequence in human motion capture.
